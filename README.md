I make software products. Some are AI-native, others I retrofit with AI.

I'm Principal AI Product Manager at [VideoMy](https://videomyjob.com/). We make employee-generated content easy and scalable for enterprise talent teams.

## What I'm working on

**[VideoMy](https://videomyjob.com/)** - I build AI features that cut video production time dramatically. I bake AI into our core features like script writing, pre-recording checks, post-recording enhancements, video editing and derivative content generation.

I'm a key contributor in internal (hobby) projects from @plannededge.

**[Goast](https://goast.app)** - A social message app, for groups conversations that matter: No admins. No drama. No spam. Just vibes. Goast is an AI-native project.

**[InvoiceGrid AI](https://invoicegrid.app/)** - An AI-powered invoice management application for Xero organisations. Invoicegrid is an AI-native project.

**[Vellma](https://vellma.app/)** - It started as a personal tools to help me communicate effectively in sensitive matters (conflict, legal conversations, emotionally-loaded issues). Vellma is a privacy-focused AI communication assistant for Gmail.

## On building AI products 

In 2025, prototyping AI features was relatively easy (and fun). Shipping them well was the hard part. 

The technical part is often straightforward (and exciting). The harder questions were about creating new UX patterns, handling new failure modes and managing generative output.

Not every opportunity needs an AI feature. Not every problem has an AI solution. But many do.
