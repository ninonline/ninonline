I build AI-powered products. Currently Principal AI Product Manager at [VideoMyJob](https://videomyjob.com/) in Melbourne, where I lead the development of AI tools that help enterprises create video content faster.

I have spent the last decade learning how to build products people actually want to use. These days, that mostly means figuring out where AI adds genuine value and where it just adds complexity.

## What I am working on now

At VideoMyJob, I work with enterprise customers like Medibank, Deloitte, and the Victorian Department of Transport to build AI features that reduce video production time from 48 hours to about 30 minutes. The work sits at the intersection of AI capability and practical business constraints.

I am also building [Goast](https://github.com/plannededge/goast), a privacy-first social messaging platform. It takes a different approach to online conversations: groups dissolve when the conversation ends, and an AI feature called the Polisher helps soften messages before they are sent. It is an experiment in whether social software can be designed to encourage better behaviour rather than engagement at any cost.

Outside of product work, I am completing a Master of Politics and Policy at Deakin University, expected in 2026. The degree is helping me think more rigorously about how technology and public policy interact, particularly around AI governance.

## The last 10+ years in product management

My path into product management started in Shanghai, where I built a SaaS accounting platform for foreign companies operating in China. That product grew from an idea to meaningful revenue over four years. It taught me how to build software for users who had very specific compliance requirements and very little patience for tools that did not work.

From there, I have worked across gaming, fintech, blockchain, and enterprise software. The industries have been different, but the core problem has been the same: understanding what people actually need and building something that solves it without overcomplicating things.

Some highlights along the way:

- Built AI features at VideoMyJob that reduced a 48-hour video production process to 30 minutes
- Grew a mobile gaming product from zero to 30,000 users in six months at Radium Games
- Led product development for a blockchain-based financial platform through seed funding and early customers
- Managed product teams across Australia and China, scaling from small founding teams to larger organisations

I have made plenty of mistakes and shipped features that did not work. That is part of the process. The useful skill is learning to recognise what went wrong and adjusting.

## How I think about AI product development

AI features are easy to build and hard to ship well. The technical implementation is often the straightforward part. The harder questions are about user expectations, failure modes, and whether the feature actually solves a problem worth solving.

I spend a lot of time on evaluation. Before building an AI feature, I want to understand how we will know if it works. That means defining acceptance thresholds, setting up offline evaluation pipelines, and planning for the cases where the model gets it wrong. Most AI features fail not because the model is bad, but because nobody thought carefully about edge cases.

On the technical side, I work with Python, LangGraph, LangChain, RAG systems, and vector databases. I have built custom MCP servers and designed multi-agent workflows. I am not a machine learning researcher, but I can build functional AI systems and I understand enough to have productive conversations with people who go deeper.

My approach is pragmatic. I am more interested in whether a feature works in production than whether it uses the most sophisticated technique. Simple solutions that ship are better than complex solutions that do not.

## Things I have built

**[Goast](https://github.com/plannededge/goast)** - A privacy-first social messaging platform with ephemeral conversations and AI features. Groups dissolve when conversations end. The AI Polisher helps soften messages while preserving intent. Currently in development with a planned launch in 2026.

**AI video tools at VideoMyJob** - Enterprise features that reduced video production time from 48 hours to 30 minutes. Built in collaboration with customers including Medibank, Deloitte, and the Victorian Department of Transport.

**Custom AI workflows** - Internal tools using MCP servers and multi-agent orchestration that reduced manual team intervention by approximately 75%.

## Writing and ideas

I write at [TechPo - Tech X Policy](https://ninonline.substack.com/) about the intersection of technology and public policy. Most posts focus on AI governance, how technology affects labour and industrial policy, and what smarter government tech policy might look like.

The writing is a way to think through problems more carefully. Some of it is speculative. I try to be clear about what I know and what I am still figuring out.

I am always interested in conversations about AI product development, technology policy, or interesting problems worth solving.
